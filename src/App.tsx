          <p>JaxBot was a CRM application, that also integrated with discord via their bot API. I custom built it for a gaming community I originally ran, and it had the ability to record users, issue warnings to users by staff, and manage forms/applications.</p>
          <p>It was created using Node.js, and used AWS RDS for database management/storage. Jax also allowed for our game servers to integrate with our discord. For example, in some games if a player was killed they would be muted in Discord until the next round.</p>
          <p>Jax was eventually shutdown when ownership of the community was passed on, and the new owner had different plans for managing it.</p>
